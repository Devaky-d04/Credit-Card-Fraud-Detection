Application of machine learning models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project applies machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions within credit card data. Using a dataset of 85,443 transactions, various classification models were evaluated, with a focus on handling class imbalance.

Project Overview
Dataset: 85,443 transactions, 30 features (V1-V28, transaction amount)
Objective: Identify fraudulent transactions (Class 1) in a highly imbalanced dataset
Models Tested: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, LightGBM, Linear SVC, Random Forest, XGBoost
Techniques: SMOTE for class balancing, StandardScaler for feature scaling
Results
Random Forest and XGBoost achieved the best accuracy, but precision for fraud detection requires further improvement.
